Original documentation for ALTO Viewer
--------------------------------------

This viewer was developed to give a visual representation of ALTO XML Files.
For more infromation on the ALTO XML standard, see the Library of Congress website: http://www.loc.gov/standards/alto/

Page layers can be turned on and off by using the toggle buttons at the top of the page

Configuration of the ALTO file location and Image file locations can be done in the config/altoview.ini file

Also image scaling can be applied to the image. This does nothing more than alter the height and width attributes of the XHTML img tag, and alters all co-ordinate data accordingly to the ratios set in the URL (0.3 on both axis in this example)
